#MetaDisorder

Disordered proteins are highly abundant in regulatory processes such as transcription and cell-signaling. Different methods
have been developed to predict protein disorder often focusing on different types of disordered regions.
Here, we present MD, a novel META-Disorder prediction method that molds various sources of information predominantly obtained 
from orthogonal prediction methods. MD significantly outperformed its constituents, and compared favorably to other top 
prediction methods. In sustained cross-validation, MD not only outperforms its origins, but it also compares favorably 
to other state-of-the-art prediction methods in a variety of tests that we applied. MD is capable of predicting disordered 
regions of all "flavors", and identifying new ones that are not captured by other predictors.
