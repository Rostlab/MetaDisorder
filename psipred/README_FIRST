DISOPRED V0.2
=============

To compile:

cc -O disord_pred.c -lm -o disopred


Usage:

Input: test.fasta (protein sequence in FASTA format)
Requires: PSIPRED to be installed

rundisopred test.fasta


NOTE rundisopred is a tcsh script analogous to the runpsipred script which is
distributed with the PSIPRED package. It runs PSI-BLAST, PSIPRED and then
DISOPRED to predict disordered regions. The end result is a PSIPRED secondary
structure prediction plus a prediction of disorder.

The pathname definitions in the script will have to be edited to define the
local installation directories.
